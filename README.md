# Life of a Chief - A Unity Game

## Summary
Life of a Chief is a strategy game made with the Unity game engine. This game was part of the final project to complete the Professional Software Development qualification with CodeClan. The project took place over 12 days and this was the first game I have created with the Unity engine and its API.

## Installation
To install the game, open the project with Unity Hub. Once opened, you will need to build the game by selecting "File" and "Build and Run". To open the game, you will need to open the application file within the installation folder.


## How to Play the Game
To play the game, select "Start" when in the main menu and enter your player name. Once you can see the map, you can move with WASD and click and hold right click to rotate the camera. Main features of the game are the ability to select, upgrade and colonise villages, trade with the ship docked at the port and to interact with random events at the end of the turn.
